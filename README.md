This is essentially one of my many creative outlets. This was originally meant to just host all of my coding stuff, but it's
essentially turned into "The Old Prodigy Website" - so yeah.

# Old Prodigy

Yep, that's right. Prodigy Reborn is back in business!

This time is different though, rather than just one version, there are several versions that cover YEARS worth of updates and content
from Prodigy's team! You can choose any one to try out based on your preferences, or several! The sky's the limit!

## Disclaimers

Old Prodigy was done first by Craftersshaft before me as "Prodigy Reborn 1.0" - and it was the inspiration for this project!

[Crafterrshaft's Github](https://github.com/craftersshaft/)

This game was made by Prodigy Education, which is a team of people co-founded by Alex Peters & Rohan Mahimker, and those two are still
head of Prodigy Education to this day!

For more information about them, [click this link!](https://www.prodigygame.com/main-en/about-prodigy/)

I am not associated with Prodigy Education or any associates/subsidiaries.

IF there is a bug in this repository, be sure to make a well-formatted issue about it. I'll try to fix it as soon as I can.

There are also various forks of this repository, you can check them out if you get the chance. I can not guarentee the quality of play
as much as I can here, but I can say they have some cool stuff you might like. There are currently 3 notable forks of this repository.
(which essentially means they actually have sites up)

 - [https://slappygig.github.io/](https://slappygig.github.io/)
 - [https://xpmuser.github.io/](https://xpmuser.github.io/)
 - [https://ao28th28.github.io/](https://ao28th28.github.io/) this one and the xpmuser one are just duplicates made by the same person,
so i don't know why you would choose one over the other, but here they both are anyway.


## How to play

First thing you have to do is get to the version selection. The following link will do just that:

[https://daboss7173.github.io/oldprodigy/select](https://daboss7173.github.io/oldprodigy/select)

Once you're there all you have to do is select a version, which will take you to the Old Prodigy login page. You don't have to worry
about logging in though. All you really have to do at this point is make your wizard!

You can create a new wizard by selecting "New Character" on the login screen. This will take you to the wizard maker, and you will be
able to choose your wizard's appearance at will. First, you will choose if you are a male or female. Next, you will be able to change
your hair style, eye color, skin color, and hair color to your liking!

Once you're created your wizard, you will get to play through the Old Prodigy tutorial, which will guide you through the basics of
the game.

One of the first things you will notice is that there is no math in the game. That's right! Old Prodigy doesn't have math! You just
choose your spell and cast them, no math necessary!

Once you're done for the day, you're gonna have to save your character. You can do so by simply clicking the gear icon in your HUD, and
then navigating the settings for the "Save Character" button. Once clicked, a new window will open up which will allow you to save your
wizard to your computer and return to it later. Once you're back to play Old Prodigy, you can select the "Load Character" option on the
Login screen.

## Modpacks

This repository features a modpack system which allows for loading specific mods into the game! This means you can choose the mods that
you want to play with, and then use them in-game.

To use these modpacks, you have to click the "Mods" button at the top-right of the version select UI. Then, you may select a version
which will bring up the mod selection menu. Once it's up, you can choose the mods you want, and then click apply to use them in-game!

These are the versions of the game that currently support modpacks at the moment:
- 1-10-0
- 1-30-0
- 1-50-0
- 2-45-0

## Version Choice Breakdown!

There are a lot of Prodigy versions to choose from.

A good starting point would be checking out Prodigy Definitive Edition. This is by far the most stable build of Prodigy on this site. If
you want to learn more about Prodigy Definitive Edition, you may scroll down a bit further.

As for those of you not playing Prodigy Definitive Edition, there's still a whole lot of other versions, albeit without all of the beefy
modifications in Prodigy Definitive Edition, these other versions are still definitely worth a play if you're looking for a different
experience.

The first page in the version selection is all of the earlier versions, the further you go, the later the versions you'll see. If you're
looking for a super early experience, select something from the first page. If you're looking for something a bit later, try the second
page. The possibilities are truely endless.

## Prodigy Definitive Edition

Prodigy Definitive Edition is a little different. This is meant to be the successor to Prodigy Reborn, but a bit beefier and with a
different version of Prodigy. Unlike the rest of the versions, this is extremely stable and has all kinds of modifications and features
added in with no extra configuration required!

Lets scratch the surface shall we?

- MAJOR Performance Enhancements
- VSync
- FPS Display
- Save Encryption
- Walk Speed Configuration
- Mailing System
- Phaser 2.20.0 Port
- Holliday Events
- Google Authentication and Autosaves

Yep, you heard that right, that's just scratching the surface. This version is based off of 1-50-0, which is already one of the most
stable and reliable of the Prodigy versions, so you can probably imagine what months of hard work can do to something like that.

## The other version

There's one version I haven't mentioned yet, it is the least buggy out of all of these versions.

The current version | The most functional build!

Huh? The current version? This isn't Old Prodigy! Well - maybe not, but it is THE Prodigy, it is more Prodigy than any of these versions.
The full-game experience is to be experienced there. There is no other version with the intricately designed education system, and there
is no other version that consistently gets updated by a dedicated team of truly wonderful people. For that, you need to play Prodigy as
it is now.
